		        <h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p style="text-align:left;">&emsp; I was born September 29, 1998 in Sioux City, Iowa. I have one brother and one sister that are both older than me. I grew up in Le Mars, Iowa and only 
			moved once (it was to a house about 5 blocks away in Le Mars). I went to Kluckhohn Elementary School where I enjoyed to play sports and learn math. 
			learn. Then I went on to Le Mars Community Middle School. Over my years of middle school I was in band, math and science bee, basketball, cross country,
			track, and even began to be interested in web development. I became interested in making web sites in middle school when I did a National History Day (NHD)
			project every year. Each year the topic was different but I always chose to make a website on my topic through Weebly. In seventh grade I was able to make it
			to the state competition and by eighth grade I made it to the national competition in Washington D.C.</p>

					&emsp; Created a bluetooth enabled dual outlet as well as a simple Android app to control it.  Each of the two outlets can be turned on and off separately by bluetooth using the app.  
					It was built by a friend and I with an arduino, a plastic box, an outlet, and some wires.  My friend did the wiring and I made the app to connect to the arduino. We both
					worked on the arduino code and connecting via bluetooth.
